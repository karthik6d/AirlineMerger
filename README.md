# AirlineMerger

Project that used network flow techniques to create an efficient and sustainable post-merger airline network after two major carriers merge. This program utilizes data publicly available from the Department of Transportation and does not rely on any insider data or models from the airline industry. In this folder is a paper (A Network Flow Based Approach for Post-Merger Airline Hub Consolidation) and well as a powerpoint. The code and data files will be added in the future after being approved by supervisors at Delta Airlines (mentors of the project). Worked on this project with partner Robert Karp at Cornell University.
